## About

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher working with Cole Trapnell and Jay Shendure at University of Washington. Before that I received my Ph.D. from Stanford University where I studied complex traits in the lab of Jonathan Pritchard. With my free time I like to dabble in watercolors and go hiking.

## Research Interests

I enjoy thinking about how DNA is translated into life. Specifically, I am interested in understanding gene regulation and the development of complex traits.
