## About

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Biomedical Informatics program at Stanford University. Before that I recieved my B.A. in Biology and Computer Science from Wesleyan University. With my free time, I like to dabble in pottery and go hiking.

## Research Interests

I enjoy thinking about how DNA is translated into life. Specifically, I am interested in the genetics of gene regulation and complex traits.
